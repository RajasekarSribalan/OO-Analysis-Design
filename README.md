# OO-Analysis-Design
Object Oriented Analysis and Design 

This project will help to understand Object oriented analysis and design from the scratch.I will start creating simple applications and will gradually build a complex design.

Project : 1 

Simple guitar search app

Package : designexamples/src/main/java/com/designexamples/searchguitar/

What will we learn from this design?
  1.Use Enums instead of using String comparisons.
  2.Enums for Type safety and value safety
  3.Use Encapsulation to group your application into logical parts (refer GuitarSpec class and its behaviour)
  4.Delegate the object and delegation makes code more reusable.
